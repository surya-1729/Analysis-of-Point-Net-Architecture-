# Analysis-of-Point-Net-Architecture-

Deep Learning on Point Sets for 3D Classification is revolutionized by PointNet architecture. PointNet architecture is evaluated as the state of the art method in 3d
classification. In this Studienarbeit, PointNet architecture is applied to 2D image data and evaluated. PointNet is highly efficient and effective on 2D data. Empirically, it shows strong performance on par or even better than the usual three layered Convolutional classification network. In this project, it is explained theoritically why the network performs relatively very well.
